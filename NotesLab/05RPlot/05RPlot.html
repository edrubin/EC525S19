## The default option: `plot()`

While we'll quickly move on to other options, .mono[R]'s `plot()` function (in the default `graphics` package) is a great tool for basic data exploration—it's fast, simple, and flexible.

--

In fact, `plot()` is a generic function, that works for many classes.

--

.hi-slate[General arguments] for `plot()`:

- `x` and `y` for coordinates
- `type =` {`"p"`oints, `"l"`ines, *etc.*} .it[.grey-light[(optional)]]
- `xlab`, `ylab`, `main`, and `sub` for axis labels and (sub)title .it[.grey-light[(optional)]]
- `col` and `pch` for color and plot character .it[.grey-light[(optional)]]
- `lty` and `lwd` for line type, and line width .it[.grey-light[(optional)]]

Let's see `plot()` in action.


```r
# Define two vectors
a &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 2*pi, by = 0.2)
b &lt;- sin(a)
```

plot(x = a, y = b)
```

```r
plot(x = a, y = b, xlab = "x", ylab = "sin(x)")
```

&lt;img src="05RPlot_files/figure-html/ex-plot2-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---


```r
plot(x = a, y = b, xlab = "x", ylab = "sin(x)", col = "blue")
```

&lt;img src="05RPlot_files/figure-html/ex-plot3-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---


```r
plot(x = a, y = b, xlab = "x", ylab = "sin(x)", col = "blue", type = "l")
```

```

`plot()` is essentially calling `points()` or `lines()`.

You can layer plots by using these individual functions.

---


```r
plot(x = a, y = b, col = "blue")
```

&lt;img src="05RPlot_files/figure-html/ex-plot7-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---


```r
plot(x = a, y = b, col = "blue"); points(x = a, y = -b, col = "orange")
```

&lt;img src="05RPlot_files/figure-html/ex-plot8-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---

`graphics` also offers a nice histogram function in `hist()`.
---
name: hist


```r
hist(x = b, breaks = 10, col = "purple", xlab = "sin(x)", main = "Wow.")
```

&lt;img src="05RPlot_files/figure-html/ex-hist-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

That said/done, further customization/manipulation of your graphics using `graphics` plotting functions can become quite difficult.

.note[Enter] `ggplot2`

# ggplot2

name: gg-intro

## The grammar

The `ggplot2` package offers an incredibly flexible, diverse, and powerful set of functions for creating graphics in .mono[R].

--

The `gg` stands for the *grammar of graphics*.

--

`ggplot2`

1. centers on a .hi-slate[data frame] (the `data` argument)
1. maps variables to .hi-slate[aesthetics] (the `aes` argument)
1. .hi-slate[layers geometries] to *build up* your graphic

.note[Note] The package is called `ggplot2`, but the main function is `ggplot()`.
---
name: ggplot
## `ggplot()`

Main arguments

1. .hi-pink[`data`] Your dataset. As a data frame (or `tibble`).

--

2. .hi-purple[`aes()`] Maps variables in `data` to "aesthetics" like `x`, `color`, `shape`.

--

.ex[Example] A time series of problems, `color` defined by money

```r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(
  data = pretend_df,
  aes(x = time, y = problems, color = money)
)
```
---
name: layers

## Layers

The `ggplot()` function doesn't plot anything—it *sets up* the plot.

To create the actual figure, you layer .hi-slate[geometries] (*e.g.*, `geom_point()`),
--
&lt;br&gt;.hi-slate[scales] (*e.g.*, `scale_color_manual()`),
--
 and other .hi-slate[options] (*e.g.*, `xlab()`).

--

You .hi-slate[add layers] using the addition sign (`+`).

--

.ex[Example] A time series of problems, `color` defined by money

```r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(
  data = pretend_df,
  aes(x = time, y = problems, color = money)
*) +
*geom_point() + geom_line()
```

Alright, let's build a plot.

We'll use the `economics` dataset that comes with `ggplot2`
&lt;br&gt;(because economics).

`ggplot2` itself is incredibly flexible/powerful.

But there are [even more packages](https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/) that extend its power—_e.g._, `ggthemes`, `gganimate`, `cowplot`, `ggmap`, `ggExtra`, and (of course) `viridis`.

name: ggsave
## Saving plots

You can save your `ggplot2`-based figures using `ggsave()`.

---
## `ggsave()` Option 1

By default, `ggsave()` saves the last plot printed to the screen.


```r
# Create a simple scatter plot
ggplot(data = fun_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
geom_point()
# Save our simple scatter plot
ggsave(filename = "simple_scatter.pdf")
```

--

.note[Notes]

- This example creates a PDF. Change to `".png"` for PNG, *etc.*
- There several helpful, optional arguments: `path`, `width`, `height`, `dpi`.

---
## `ggsave()` Option 2

You can assign your `ggplot()` objects to memory

```r
# Create a simple scatter plot named 'gg_points'
gg_points &lt;- ggplot(data = fun_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
geom_point()
```

--

We can then save this figure with the name `gg_points` using `ggsave()`

```r
# Save our simple scatter plot name 'ggsave'
ggsave(
  filename = "simple_scatter.pdf",
  plot = gg_points
)
```
