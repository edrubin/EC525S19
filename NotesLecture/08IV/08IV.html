## Selection on observables and/or unobservables

We've been focusing on .hi-slate[*selection-on-observables* designs], _i.e._,
$$
`\begin{align}
  \left(\text{Y}_{0i},\, \text{Y}_{1i}\right) \ci \text{D}_{i}|\text{X}_{i}
\end{align}`
$$
for .hi-slate[observable] variables `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.

--

.hi-pink[*Selection-on-unobservable* designs] replace this assumption with two new (but related) assumptions

1. `\(\left(\text{Y}_{0i},\, \text{Y}_{1i}\right) \perp \text{Z}_{i}\)`

2. `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \text{Z}_{i},\, \text{D}_{i} \right) \neq 0\)`

---
## Selection on observables and/or unobservables

Our main goal in causal-inference minded (applied) econometrics boils down to isolating .b["good" variation] in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` (exogenous/as-good-as-random) from .b["bad" variation] (the part of `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` correlated with `\(\text{Y}_{0i}\)` and `\(\text{Y}_{1i}\)`).

--

(We want to avoid selection bias.)

--

- .hi-slate[Selection-on-observables designs] assume that we can control for all *bad variation* (selection) in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` through a known (observed) `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.

--

- .hi-pink[Selection-on-unobservables designs] assume that we can extract part of the *good variation* in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` (generally using some `\(\text{Z}_{i}\)`) and then use this *good* part of `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` to estimate the effect of `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` on `\(\text{Y}_{i}\)`.
--
 We throw away the *bad variation* in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` (it's bad).
---
## Which route?

So set of research designs is more palatable?

--

1. There are plenty of bad applications of both sets.&lt;br&gt;.purple[Violated assumptions, bad controls, *etc.*]

--

1. .hi-slate[Selection on observables] assumes we know .it[everything] about selection into treatment—we can identify .it[all] of the good (or bad) variation in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)`.
--
&lt;br&gt;.purple[Tough in non-experimental settings. Difficult to validate in practice.]

--

1. .hi-pink[Selection on unobservables] assumes we can isolate .it[some] good/clean variation in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)`, which we then use to estimate the effect of `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` on `\(\text{Y}_{i}\)`.
--
&lt;br&gt;.purple[Seems more plausible. Possible to validate. May be underpowered.]

name: intro
## Introduction

.attn[Instrumental variables] (IV).super[.pink[†]] is the canonical selection-on-unobservables design—isolating *good variation* in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` via some magical .pink[instrument] `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)`.

.footnote[.pink[†] For the moment, we're lumping together IV and two-stage least squares (2SLS) together—as many people do—even though they are technically different.]

--

Consider some model (structural equation)
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \varepsilon_i \tag{1}
\end{align}`
$$
To guarantee consistent OLS estimates for `\(\beta_1\)`, want `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \text{D}_{i},\,\varepsilon_i \right)=0\)`.
&lt;br&gt; In general, this is a heroic assumption.

--

.note[Alternative:] Estimate `\(\beta_1\)` via instrumental variables.

## Definition

For our model
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \varepsilon_i \tag{1}
\end{align}`
$$

A valid .attn[instrument] is a variable `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)` such that

1. `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}},\, \text{D}_{i} \right) \neq 0\)`
--
&lt;br&gt;our .pink[instrument] correlates with treatment
--
 (so we can keep part of `\(\text{D}_{i}\)`)

--

2. `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}},\, \varepsilon_i \right) = 0\)`
--
&lt;br&gt;our .pink[instrument] is uncorrelated with other (non- `\(\!\!\text{D}_{i}\)`) determinants of `\(\text{Y}_{i}\)`
--
, _i.e._, `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)` is excludable from equation `\((1)\)`.
--
 .attn[(exclusion restriction)]

name: example
## Example

Back to the returns to a college degree,
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Income}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Grad}_i + \varepsilon_i
\end{align}`
$$
OLS is likely biased.

--

What if that state conducts a (random) .hi-pink[lottery] for scholarships?

--

Let `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Lottery}_i}\)` denote an indicator for whether `\(i\)` won a lottery scholarship..super[.pink[†]]

.footnote[.pink[†] We'll have to focus on families who were eligible/who applied.]

--

1. `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \color{#e64173}{\text{Lottery}_i},\, \text{Grad}_i \right)\neq 0\)` `\(\left( &gt;0 \right)\)` if scholarships increase grad. rates.

--

2. `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left(\color{#e64173}{\text{Lottery}_i},\, \varepsilon_i\right) = 0\)` since the lottery is randomized.

## The IV estimator

The IV estimator for our model
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \varepsilon_i \tag{1}
\end{align}`
$$
with (valid) instrument `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)` is
$$

\end{align}`
$$

If you have no covariates, then
$$

\end{align}`
$$
---

If you have additional (exogenous) covariates `\(\text{X}_i\)`, then
$$
`\begin{align}

# Two-stage least squares

---
class: inverse, middle
---
name: setup
## Setup

You'll commonly see IV implemented as a two-stage process known as&lt;br&gt;.attn[two-stage least squares] (2SLS).

--

.attn[First stage] Estimate the effect of the instrument `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)` on our endogenous variable `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` and (predetermined) covariates `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`. Save `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\text{D}}_{i}}\)`.

$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{D}_{i} = \gamma_1 \color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}} + \gamma_2 \text{X}_{i} + u_i
\end{align}`
$$

--

.attn[Second stage] Estimate model we wanted—but only using the variation in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` that correlates with `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)`, _i.e._, `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\text{D}}_{i}}\)`.

$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \beta_1 \color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\text{D}}_{i}} + \beta_2 \text{X}_{i} + \varepsilon_i
\end{align}`
$$

.note[Note] The controls `\(\text{X}_{i}\)` must match in the first and second stages.

---
## IV estimation

This two-step procedure, with a valid instrument, produces an estimator `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` that is consistent for `\(\beta_1\)`.

$$
`\begin{align}
  \hat{\beta}_\text{2SLS} &amp;= \left( \text{D}' \text{P}_{\text{Z}} \text{D} \right)^{-1} \left( \text{D}' \text{P}_{\text{Z}} \text{Y} \right)
  \\[0.3em]
  \text{P}_{\text{Z}} &amp;= \text{Z} \left( \text{Z}'\text{Z} \right)^{-1} \text{Z}'
\end{align}`
$$

where `\(\text{D}\)` is a matrix of our treatment and predetermined covariates `\(\left( \text{X}_{i} \right)\)` and `\(Z\)` is a matrix of our instrument and our predetermined covariates.

---
## IV estimation

Important notes

- The controls `\(\left( \text{X}_{i} \right)\)` must match in the first and second stages.

- If you have exactly .hi-slate[one instrument] and exactly .hi-slate[one endogenous variable], then 2SLS and IV are identical.

- Your second-stage standard errors are not correct.

---
name: reduced-form
## The reduced form

In addition to the regressions within the two stages of 2SLS
1. `\(\text{D}_{i} = \gamma_1 \color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}} + \gamma_2 \text{X}_{i} + u_i\)`
2. `\(\text{Y}_{i} = \beta_1 \color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\text{D}}_{i}} + \beta_2 \text{X}_{i} + \varepsilon_i\)`

there is a third important and related regression: the reduced form.

--

The .attn[reduced form] regresses the outcome `\(\text{Y}_{i}\)` (LHS of the second stage) on our instrument `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)` and covariates `\(\text{X}_{i}\)` (RHS of the first stage).
$$
`\begin{align}
   \text{Y}_{i} = \pi_1 \color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}} + \pi_2 \text{X}_{i} + u_i
\end{align}`
$$
--
Thus, the reduced form provides a consistent estimate of the causal effect of our instrument on the outcome.
---
## The reduced form, continued

While the reduced form estimates the causal effect of the instrument on our outcome, we're often actually interested in the effect of *treatment* `\(\left( \text{D}_{i} \right)\)`.

--

That said, the reduced form is still incredibly helpful/important:

- Clarifies your source of identifying variation.
--

- Does not suffer from *weak instruments* problems.
--

- Only requires `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \text{Z}_{i},\, \varepsilon_i \right) = 0\)`.
--

- Offers insights into your estimates
--

$$
`\begin{align}
  \widehat{\beta}_{1}^\text{2SLS} = \dfrac{\widehat{\pi}_{1}}{\widehat{\gamma}_{1}}
\end{align}`
$$
when you have exactly one instrument.

---
name: reduced-intuition
## The reduced form, intuition

This expression for the 2SLS (and IV) estimator can be very helpful.
$$
`\begin{align}
  \widehat{\beta}_{1}^\text{2SLS} = \dfrac{\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\pi}_{1}}}{\color{#20B2AA}{\widehat{\gamma}_{1}}} = \dfrac{\color{#6A5ACD}{\text{Reduced-form estimate}}}{\color{#20B2AA}{\text{First-stage estimate}}}
\end{align}`
$$

--

What's the interpretation/intuition?

--

Back to our example: `\(\widehat{\beta}_1 =\)` est. effect of college graduation on income.

--

`\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\pi}_1}\)` gives the estimated causal effect of the scholarship lottery on income
--
, but what share of lottery winners graduate? We need to rescale if `\(&lt;\)` 100%.

--

`\(\color{#20B2AA}{\widehat{\gamma}_1}\)` estimates the effect of winning the scholarship lottery on graduation
--
—the share of winners who graduated due to winning.
--
 We can scale with `\(\color{#20B2AA}{\widehat{\gamma}_1}\)`!
---
name: reduced-example
## The reduced form, example

To see why this scaling makes sense, imagine that 50% of lottery winners graduate from college due to the lottery, _i.e._, `\(\color{#20B2AA}{\widehat{\gamma}_1 =}\)` .turquoise[0.50]..super[.pink[†]]

.footnote[.pink[†] Imagine none of the applicants would have graduated otherwise]

--

Our reduced-form estimate of `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\pi}_1=}\)` .purple[$5,000] says that lottery winners make $5,000 more than the control group, on average.

--

However, half of the winners did not graduate, so `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\pi}_1}\)` "underestimates" the effect of college graduation by combining graduates by nongraduates.

--

Thus, we want to double `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\pi}_1}\)`, _i.e._, divide by `\(\color{#20B2AA}{\widehat{\gamma}_1}\)`:
`\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\pi}_1}/\color{#20B2AA}{\widehat{\gamma}_1}\)` = .turquoise[$5,000]/.purple[0.5] = $10,000.
---
name: reduced-derivation

.qa[Q] How do we get this magical expression? `\(\left( \widehat{\beta}_1^\text{IV} = \dfrac{\widehat{\pi}_1}{\widehat{\gamma}_1} \right)\)`

--

## Derivation

--

`\(\widehat{\beta}_1^\text{IV} = \left( \text{Z}'\text{D} \right)^{-1} \left( \text{Z}'\text{Y} \right)\)`

--

`\(\color{#ffffff}{\widehat{\beta}_1^\text{IV}} = \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}'\widetilde{\text{D}} \right)^{-1} \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}'\text{Y} \right)\)`   applying FWL to reduce `\(\text{D}\)` and `\(\text{Z}\)` to vectors.

--

`\(\color{#ffffff}{\widehat{\beta}_1^\text{IV}} = \dfrac{\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}_{i},\, \text{Y}_{i} \right)}{\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}_i,\, \widetilde{\text{D}}_{i} \right)}\)`
--
 `\(= \dfrac{\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}_{i},\, \text{Y}_{i} \right)/\mathop{\text{Var}} \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}_i \right)}{\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}_i,\, \widetilde{\text{D}}_{i} \right)/\mathop{\text{Var}} \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}_i \right)}\)`

# IV: Mechanics and intuition

name: iv-intuition

## Setup

In this section, we'll use medical trials as a working example..super[.pink[†]]

.footnote[.pink[†] Credit/thanks go to [Michael Anderson](https://are.berkeley.edu/~mlanderson/ARE_Website/Home.html) for this example—and much of these notes.]

--

We are interested in the regression model for the effect of some treatment (_e.g._, blood-pressure medication) on medical outcome `\(\text{Y}_{i}\)`
--
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \varepsilon_i
\end{align}`
$$
`\(\text{D}_{i}\)` indicates whether `\(i\)` *takes* the treatment (medication). `\(\varepsilon_i\)` captures all other factors that affect `\(\text{Y}_{i}\)`.
--
 Or in potential-outcomes framework:

$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} &amp;= \text{Y}_{1i} \text{D}_{i} + \text{Y}_{0i} (1-\text{D}_{i}) \\
  \text{Y}_{0i} &amp;= \beta_0 + \varepsilon_i \\
  \text{Y}_{1i} &amp;= \text{Y}_{0i} + \beta_1
\end{align}`
$$

--

.note[Analysis 1] .attn[Intention to treat] (.attn[ITT]): `\(\widehat{\beta}_1^\text{ITT} = \overline{\text{Y}}_\text{Trt} - \overline{\text{Y}}_\text{Ctrl}\)`

--

.note[Analysis 2] .hi-slate[IV!]
--
 Instrument medication `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` with intention to treat `\(\text{Z}_{i}\)`.
---
## The IV solution

First question: Is `\(\text{Z}_{i}\)` a valid instrument for `\(\text{D}_{i}\)`?

--

1. `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \text{Z}_{i},\, \varepsilon_i \right) = 0\)` as `\(\text{Z}_{i}\)` was randomly assigned (exclusion restriction).

--

1. `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \text{Z}_{i},\, \text{D}_{i} \right)\neq 0\)` if assignment to treatment changes the likelihood you take the pills (first stage).

--

∴ `\(\text{Z}_{i}\)` is a valid instrument for `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` and IV consistently estimates `\(\beta_1\)`.
---
name: iv-noncompliance
## Noncompliance

.attn[Noncompliant] individuals do not abide by their treatment assignment.

--

Let's see how IV "solves" this problems.

--

First, assume noncompliance only affects treated individuals—*i.e.*, treated folks sometimes don't take their pills; control folks never take pills.

---
## Noncompliance, continued

The .hi-slate[first stage] recovers the share of treatment individuals who take the pill
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{D}_{i} = \gamma_1 \text{Z}_{i} + u_i
\end{align}`
$$
--
*i.e.*, if 50% of treated individuals take the medication, `\(\widehat{\gamma} =\)` 0.50.

--

The .hi-slate[reduced form] estimates the *ITT*
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \pi_1 \text{Z}_{i} + v_i
\end{align}`
$$
--
which we know IV rescales using the first stage
$$
`\begin{align}
  \widehat{\beta}_{1}^\text{IV} = \dfrac{\widehat{\pi}_1}{\widehat{\gamma}_1} = \dfrac{\widehat{\pi}_1}{0.50} =
  2 \times \widehat{\pi}_1
\end{align}`
$$
---
name: iv-rescale
## Noncompliance, continued

IV solves the noncompliance issue by rescaling by the rate of compliance.

--

If everyone perfectly complies, then `\(\widehat{\gamma}_1 = 1\)` and `\(\widehat{\beta}_{1}^\text{IV} = \widehat{\pi}_1/1 = \widehat{\beta}_{1}^\text{ITT}\)`.

--

.ex[Further example] `\(N_\text{Trt}\)` = 10; trt. compliance = 50%; ctrl. compliance = 100%.

`\(\overline{\text{Y}}_\text{Trt} = \dfrac{5 (\beta_0 + \beta_1) + 5 (\beta_0)}{10} = \beta_0 + \dfrac{\beta_1}{2}\)`
--
 and `\(\overline{\text{Y}}_\text{Ctrl} = \beta_0\)`.

--

So our reduced-form estimate (the ITT) is `\(\widehat{\gamma}_1 = \dfrac{\beta_1}{2}\)` (half the true effect).

--

IV consistently estimates `\(\beta_1\)` via rescaling the ITT by the rate of compliance
$$
`\begin{align}
  \widehat{\beta}_1^\text{IV} = \dfrac{\pi}{\gamma} = \dfrac{\beta_1/2}{1/2} = \beta_1
\end{align}`
$$

## Recap

Throughout the course, we've discussed two concepts of treatment effects.

--

1. .attn[Average treatment effect] (.attn[ATE]) The average treatment effect for an individual randomly drawn from our sample.

--

1. .attn[Treatment on the treated] (.attn[TOT]) The average treatment effect for a .it.hi-slate[treated] individual
randomly drawn from our sample.

--

When we assume homogeneous/constant treatment effects, ATE = TOT.

--

.qa[Q] If treatment effects vary, then what do IV and 2SLS estimate?

--

.qa[A] Not ATE.
--
 And not TOT.
--
 They estimate the LATE..super[.pink[†]]

 .footnote[
 .pink[†] See [Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2291629).
 ]
---
## The LATE

IV generally estimates the .attn[LATE]—the .attn[Local Average Treatment Effect].

--

.note[Recall] IV "works" by isolating variation in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` induced by our instrument `\(\text{Z}_{i}\)`.

--

In other words: IV focuses on the individuals whose `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` changes due to `\(\text{Z}_{i}\)`.

Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996) call these folks .attn[compliers].

--

However, *compliers* are only one of four possible groups.

.col-left[
1. .attn[Compliers] `\(\text{D}_{i} = 1\)` iff `\(\text{Z}_{i}=1\)`.

## The LATE

Because IV only uses variation in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` that correlates with `\(\text{Z}_{i}\)`, IV mechanically drops *always-takers* and *never-takers*.

--

Most IV derivations/applications assume away the existence of *defiers*.

--

Thus, IV estimates a treatment effect .hi-slate[using only *compliers*].

--

Hence the "local" in *local average treatment effect*.
---
name: late-ex
## The LATE: Medical-trial example

Imagine treatment works for some `\(\left( \beta_{1,i} &lt; 0 \right)\)` and not for others `\(\left( \beta_{1,j} = 0 \right)\)`.

Suppose individuals know their response to blood-pressure medication.

--
- `\(\beta_{1,i}&lt;0\)` individuals always take the pill.

--
- `\(\beta_{1,j}=0\)` individuals only take the pill when treated.

--

Then our compliers will be individuals for whom `\(\beta_{1,j}=0\)`.

--

Thus, IV's LATE will indicate no treatment effect `\(\left( \widehat{\beta}_1^\text{IV} = 0 \right)\)`.

---
## The LATE

.qa[Q] So is IV actually inconsistent?

--

.qa[A] It depends what you are trying to estimate (and how you interpret it).

IV doesn't estimate the ATE or TOT, so it would be inconsistent for them..super[.pink[†]]

.footnote[
.pink[†] Just as the TOT is not consistent for the ATE.
]

--

IV estimates the *local* average treatment effect.

--

.note[Takeaway] Because IV identifies off of compliers, it estimates an average treatment effect for these individuals (who *comply* with the instrument).

--

.note[Takeaway.sub[2]] Different instruments have different LATEs.

name: monotonicity
## Monotonicity

We've already written down the two classical IV/2SLS assumptions

- .note[First stage:] `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \text{Z}_{i},\, \text{D}_{i} \right) &gt; 0\)`
- .note[Exclusion restriction:] `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \text{Z}_{i},\, \varepsilon_{i} \right) = 0\)`

but we need a third assumption to get ensure IV's complier-based LATE interpretation.

--

- .attn[Monotonicity] (.attn[Uniformity]).attn[:] `\(\text{D}_{i}(z)\geq \text{D}_{i}(z')\)` or `\(\text{D}_{i}(z)\leq \text{D}_{i}(z') \enspace \forall i\)`
&lt;br&gt; [Heckman](chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/http://jenni.uchicago.edu/papers/koop2006/koop2-IV_ho_2006-09-25a_mms.pdf): *Uniformity* of responses *across persons.*
&lt;br&gt; [Imbens and Angrist (1994)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951620): Instrument has monotone effect on `\(\text{D}_{i}\)`.
---
## Monotonicity

If "defiers" exist, then monotonicity/uniformity is violated.

--

In this case, the IV estimand is

$$
`\begin{align}
  \dfrac{\tau_{c} \mathop{\text{Pr}}\left(\text{complier}\right) - \tau_{d} \mathop{\text{Pr}}\left(\text{defier}\right)}{ \mathop{\text{Pr}}\left(\text{complier}\right) -  \mathop{\text{Pr}}\left(\text{defier}\right)}
\end{align}`
$$

which is not bound between `\(\tau_{c}\)` and `\(\tau_{d}\)`.

--

.ex[Example] `\(\tau_c=\)` 1 and `\(\tau_d=\)` 2. `\(\mathop{\text{Pr}}\left(\text{complier}\right)=\)` 2/3 and `\(\mathop{\text{Pr}}\left(\text{defier}\right)=\)` 1/3.

--

Then the "LATE" is 0..super[.pink[†]]

.footnote[
.pink[†] Some people would instead say that there is no LATE when you violate monotonicity.

# Multiple instruments

---
class: inverse, middle
name: multi-inst
---
## Motivation

.qa[Q] Why include multiple instruments?

--

.qa[A] Multiple instruments can capture more variation in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` (efficiency).

--

Using terminology from the *system-of-equations* literature,

- one instrument for one endogenous variable: .attn[just identified]
- multiple instruments for one endogenous variable: .attn[over identified]

---
## In practice

With (valid) instruments `\(\text{Z}_{1i}\)` and `\(\text{Z}_{2i}\)`, or first stage becomes
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{D}_{i} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \text{Z}_{1i} + \gamma_2 \text{Z}_{2i} + \gamma_3 \text{X}_{i} + u_i
\end{align}`
$$

--

while our second stage is still
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \widehat{\text{D}}_{i} + \beta_2 \text{X}_{i} + v_i
\end{align}`
$$

# Multiple instruments
## Example: Quarter of birth

---
name: multi-ex

Back to our quest to estimate the returns to education.

--

[Angrist and Krueger (1991)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2937954) proposed *quarter of birth* as a set of instruments for years of schooling.

--

Accordingly, their first stage looks something like.super[.pink[†]]

.footnote[
.pink[†] We need to drop one of the quarter-of-birth indicators to avoid perfect collinearity.
]

$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Schooling}_i = \gamma_0 &amp;+ \gamma_1 \mathbb{I}(\text{Born Q1})_{i} + \gamma_2 \mathbb{I}(\text{Born Q2})_{i}
  \\&amp;+ \gamma_3 \mathbb{I}(\text{Born Q3})_{i} + \gamma_4 \mathbb{I}(\text{Born Q4})_{i}
  \\&amp;+ \gamma_5 \text{X}_{i} + u_{i}
\end{align}`
$$


---
.qa[Q] Is quarter of birth a valid instrument?

--

.qa[Q1] Why would quarter of birth affect schooling? (.note[First stage])

--

.qa[A1] Students cannot drop out of school until a certain age, and quarter of birth affects your age at the time you begin school.

--

.ex[Example] Some states require students to stay in school until they are 16.
- Students who start school at age .hi-slate[6] drop out after .hi-slate[10] years of schooling.
- Students who start school at age .hi-slate[5] drop out after .hi-slate[11] years of schooling.

---
If students must begin school in calendar year in which they turn 6
- December birthdates: begin school at 5.75; drop out with 10.25 yrs.
- January birthdates: begin school at 6.75; drop out with 9.25 yrs.

--

For some group, quarter of birth may affect the number of years in school.
---

It turns out that the first stage is also pretty weak in this setting.

.attn[Weak instruments] can cause several problems for 2SLS/IV:

--

1. Our estimator is a ratio of the reduced form and the first stage, so a weak first stage can blow up reduced-form estimates (amplifying reduced-form noise/bias).

--

2. Many weak instruments lead to a finite-sample issue in which 2SLS is biased toward OLS—our first stage is essentially overfitting.

--

What about our other requirements for a valid instrument?

---
.qa[Q2] Is quarter of birth uncorrelated with `\(\varepsilon_i\)` (.note[excludable])?

--

.qa[A2] While quarter of birth may be fairly arbitrary for some families, other families might time births.

If these birth timers differ from other couples along other dimensions (_e.g._, income or education), then quarter of birth may correlate with `\(\varepsilon_i\)`.
---
.qa[Q3] Is the effect monotone?

--

.qa[A3] Some.super[.pink[†]] argue that monotonicity may be violated in this setting.

.footnote[
.pink[†] _E.g._, [Aliprantis (2012)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/1076998610396885)
]

--

Consider December births.

--

- Original idea: December birthdates will start school at age 5.7, inducing more years of education before 16.

--

- *Redshirting* idea: Parents hold back December kids so they can be older (_i.e._, 6.7), inducing fewer years of education before 16.

# 2SLS and .mono[R]

---
name: 2sls-r

## `estimatr`

You can implement 2SLS/IV in many ways in .mono[R].

Today: `esitmatr` and `iv_robust()`.

--

Specifically, we give `iv_robust()` the relationship that we want separted from the instrument by `|`

--
, *e.g.*,




```r
# Estimate 2SLS
iv_robust(Y ~ D | Z, data = sample_df, se_type = "classical") %&gt;%
  tidy() %&gt;% select(1:5)
```

```
#&gt;          term estimate std.error statistic      p.value
#&gt; 1 (Intercept) 5.786204 2.9744230  1.945320 0.0546020456
#&gt; 2           D 1.107801 0.3043264  3.640173 0.0004372703
```
---

## Now in two stages!

Of course, we can estimate 2SLS in two stages.


```r
# First stage
stage1 &lt;- lm_robust(D ~ Z, data = sample_df, se_type = "classical")
# First-stage results
stage1 %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% select(1:5)
```

```
#&gt;          term  estimate std.error statistic      p.value
#&gt; 1 (Intercept) 8.8226148 0.3169568 27.835389 2.486413e-48
#&gt; 2           Z 0.3257347 0.1031506  3.157857 2.112927e-03
```
---

## Second stage

We just need to add `\(\widehat{\text{D}}_{i}\)` to our dataset.


```r
# Add fitted (first-stage) values to data
sample_df %&lt;&gt;% mutate(D_hat = stage1$fitted.values)
# Second stage
stage2 &lt;- lm_robust(Y ~ D_hat, data = sample_df, se_type = "classical")
# Second-stage results
stage2 %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% select(1:5)
```

```
#&gt;          term estimate std.error statistic    p.value
#&gt; 1 (Intercept) 5.786204 5.4132099  1.068904 0.28773854
#&gt; 2       D_hat 1.107801 0.5538496  2.000184 0.04824759
```

## Standard errors

However, recall that our second-stage standard errors are not correct.

# IV and 2SLS
## Conclusions

name: conclusions

1. IV/2SLS focus on .hi-slate[isolating some "good" variation] in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` via `\(\text{Z}_{i}\)`.

1. Important .hi-slate[requirements]: strong first stage, excludability, monotonicity.

1. IV and 2SLS .hi-slate[rescale the reduced form] with the first stage.

1. Estimates are .hi-slate[LATE from compliers].

1. Different instruments can produce .hi-slate[different LATEs].

1. A .hi-slate[weak first stage] can lead to problems.
