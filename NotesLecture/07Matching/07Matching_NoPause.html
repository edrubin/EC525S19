# Follow up

## OLS weighting

At the beginning of the lecture, we discussed OLS weights—especially for heterogeneous treatment effects.

We should keep our questions clear.

1. Which weights on `\(\beta_1\)` and `\(\beta_2\)` recover `\(\beta_{12}\)`, where `\(\beta_i\)` comes from a regression using observations in group `\(i\)`?

2. What does `\(\beta\)` represent when the treatment effect is heterogeneous?

More soon.

## The gist

Remember the .hi[conditional independence assumption].super[.pink[†]] in a setting—_i.e._, treatment is as-good-as random conditional on a known set of covariates?

.footnote[.pink[†] AKA "selection on observables"]


.hi[Matching estimators] take us at our word.


If we really believe `\(\left(\text{Y}_{1i},\, \text{Y}_{0i} \right)\ci \text{D}_{i}|\text{X}_{i}\)`, then we can just calculate a bunch of treatment effects conditional on `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`, _i.e._,
$$
`\begin{align}
  \tau(x) = \mathop{E}\left[ \text{Y}_{1i} - \text{Y}_{0i} \mid \text{X}_{i} = x \right]
\end{align}`
$$


.note[The idea:] Estimate a treatment effect only using observations with (nearly?) identical values of `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.
 The CIA buys us causality within these groups.
---
name: goals
## Goals

Let's return to .b[the fundamental problem of causal inference] for a moment.

1. We want/need to know `\(\tau_i = \text{Y}_{1i} - \text{Y}_{0i}\)`.
2. We cannot simultaneously observe *both* `\(\text{Y}_{1i}\)` *and* `\(\text{Y}_{0i}\)`.


Most empirical strategies boil to strategies to estimate `\(\text{Y}_{0i}\)` for treated individuals—the unobservable counterfactual for the treatment group.


Matching is no different.

We match untreated observations to treated observations using `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`, _i.e._, calculate a `\(\widehat{\text{Y}_{0i}}\)` for each `\(\text{Y}_{1i}\)`, based upon "matched" untreated individuals.
---
## More formally

We want to construct a counterfactual for each individual with `\(\text{D}_{i}=1\)`.


The counterfactual for `\(i\)` should only use individuals that match `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.


Let there be `\(N_T\)` treated individuals and `\(N_C\)` control individuals. We want
- `\(N_T\)` sets of weights
- with `\(N_C\)` weights in each set
: `\(w_i(j)\, \left( i = 1,\,\ldots,\, N_T;\, j=1,\,\ldots,\, N_C \right)\)`


Assume `\(\sum_j w_i(j) = 1\)`. Our estimate for the counterfactual of treated `\(i\)` is
$$
`\begin{align}
  \widehat{\text{Y}_{0i}} = \sum_{j\in \left( D=0 \right)} w_i(j) \text{Y}_{j}
\end{align}`
$$
---
name: generic
## More formally

If our estimated counterfactual for treated individual `\(i\)` is
$$
`\begin{align}
  \widehat{\text{Y}_{0i}} = \sum_j w_i(j) \text{Y}_{j}
\end{align}`
$$
then our estimated treatment effect (for individual `\(i\)`) is
$$
`\begin{align}
  \hat{\tau}_i = \text{Y}_{1i} - \widehat{\text{Y}_{0i}} = \text{Y}_{1i} - \sum_j w_i(j) \text{Y}_{j}
\end{align}`
$$


∴ a generic matching estimator for the treatment effect on the treated is
$$
`\begin{align}
  \hat{\tau}_M = \dfrac{1}{N_T} \sum_{i \in \left( \text{D}=1 \right)} \left( \text{Y}_{1i} - \widehat{\text{Y}_{0i}} \right) = \dfrac{1}{N_T} \sum_{i \in \left( \text{D}=1 \right)} \left( \text{Y}_{1i} - \sum_{j\in \left( D=0 \right)} w_i(j) \text{Y}_{j} \right)
\end{align}`
$$

So all we need is those weights and we're done..super[.pink[††]]

.qa[Q] Where does one find these handy weights?


.qa[A] You've got options, but you need to choose carefully/responsibly.

*E.g.*, if `\(w_i(j) = \frac{1}{N_C}\)` for all `\((i,j)\)`, then we're back to a difference in means.
&lt;br&gt; This weighting doesn't abide by our conditional independence assumption.


.note[The plan] Choose weights `\(w_i(j)\)` that indicate .hi-slate[*how close*] `\(\text{X}_{j}\)` is to `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.
---
name: discrete
## Proximity

Our weights `\(w_i(j)\)` should be a measure of .hi-slate[*how close*] `\(\text{X}_{j}\)` is to `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.


If `\(\text{X}\)` is .hi-pink[discrete], then we can consider equality, _i.e._, `\(w_i(j) = \mathbb{I}(\text{X}_{i} = \text{X}_{j})\)`, scaling as necessary to get `\(\sum_j w_i(j) = 1\)`.

---
name: nn-euclidean
## Proximity

Our weights `\(w_i(j)\)` should be a measure of .hi-slate[*how close*] `\(\text{X}_{j}\)` is to `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.

If `\(\text{X}\)` is .hi-purple[continuous], then we need .it[proximity] rather than .it[equality].


.purple[*Nearest-neighbor* matching] chooses the single closest control observation using the Euclidean distance between `\(\text{X}_{i}\)` and `\(\text{X}_{j}\)`, _i.e._,

$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{d}_{i,j} = \left( \text{X}_{i} - \text{X}_{j} \right)'\left(\text{X}_{i} - \text{X}_{j}\right)
\end{align}`
$$


- `\(\hat{\tau}_i = \text{Y}_{1i} - \text{Y}_{0j}^i\)`, where `\(\text{Y}_{0j}^i\)` is `\(i\)`'s nearest neighbor in the control group.
- .hi-slate[Estimator:] `\(\hat{\tau}_M = \frac{1}{N_T} \sum_i \hat{\tau}_i\)`
- Produces causal estimates if CIA is valid *and* we have sufficient overlap.
- Suffers from arbitrary choices of units.

---
name: nn-mahalanobis
## Proximity

Our weights `\(w_i(j)\)` should be a measure of .hi-slate[*how close*] `\(\text{X}_{j}\)` is to `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.

If `\(\text{X}\)` is .hi-purple[continuous], then we need .it[proximity] rather than .it[equality].

.purple[*Nearest-neighbor* matching with Mahalanobis distance] chooses the single closest control using .purple[Mahalanobis] distance between `\(\text{X}_{i}\)` and `\(\text{X}_{j}\)`, _i.e._,

$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{d}_{i,j} = \left( \text{X}_{i} - \text{X}_{j} \right)' \Sigma_{X}^{-1} \left(\text{X}_{i} - \text{X}_{j}\right)
\end{align}`
$$
where `\(\Sigma_{X}^{-1}\)` is the covariance matrix of `\(\text{X}\)`.


- .hi-slate[Estimator:] `\(\hat{\tau}_M = \frac{1}{N_T} \sum_i \hat{\tau}_i\)` where `\(\left(\hat{\tau}_i = \text{Y}_{1i} - \text{Y}_{0j}^i\right)\)`
- Produces causal estimates if CIA is valid *and* we have sufficient overlap.
- Does not suffer from arbitrary choices of units.
---
## More neighbors?

Why limit ourselves to a .b[single] "best" match?

If we're going to let a function/algorithm choose the *nearest* match, can't we also let the function/algorithm choose *how many* matches?

Furthermore, if `\(N_C \gg N_T\)`, it we're throwing away *a lot* of information.

We could instead use this information and be more efficient.

---
name: kernel
## More neighbors!

.purple[Kernel matching] gives positive weight to all control observations within some .hi-slate[bandwidth] `\(h\)`, with higher weight for closer matches determined by some .hi-slate[kernel function] `\(K(\cdot)\)`,
$$
`\begin{align}
  w_i(j) = \dfrac{K\!\!\left( \dfrac{\text{X}_{j} - \text{X}_{i}}{h} \right)}{\sum_{j\in(D=0)} K\!\!\left(\dfrac{\text{X}_{j} - \text{X}_{i}}{h} \right)}
\end{align}`

# Kernels
## Aside

Kernel functions are good for more than just matching.

You will most commonly see/use them smoothing out densities—providing a smooth, moving-window average.


_E.g._, .mono[R]'s (`ggplot2`'s) smooth, density-plotting function `geom_density()`.

`geom_density()` defaults to `kernel = "gaussian"`, but you can specify many other kernel functions (including `"epanechnikov"`).


You can also change the `bandwidth` argument. The default is a bandwidth-choosing function called `bw.nrd0()`.

# Matching

---
## Adding neighbors

As we add more neighbors—either moving from `\(1\)` to `\(n&gt;1\)` or increasing our bandwidth—we potentially increase the efficiency of our estimator.


We need to .hi[be careful not to add *too many* controls] for each treated `\(i\)`.


CIA requires that we're actually conditioning on the observables—it does not allow us to take a simple average across all control observations.
---
## The curse of dimensionality.super[.pink[†]]

.footnote[.pink[†] I'm not sure if this is a title for Harry Potter or Indiana Jones... crossover anyone?]

It turns out kernel- and bandwidth-selection are not our biggest enemies.


As the dimension of `\(\text{X}\)` expands (matching on more variables), it becomes .hi[harder and harder to find a nice, close control] for each treated unit.


We need a way to shrink the dimensionality of `\(\text{X}\)`.

name: setup
## Setup

Let's begin with two assumptions—one old and one new.

1. .hi-purple[Conditional independence:] `\(\left( \text{Y}_{0i},\, \text{Y}_{1i} \right) \ci \text{D}_{i}|\text{X}_{i}\)`

2. .hi-purple[Overlap:] `\(0 &lt; \mathop{\text{Pr}}\left(\text{D}_{i} = 1 \mid \text{X}_{i}\right) &lt; 1\)`


We can estimate an average treatment effect by conditioning on `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.


However, overlap may fail if the dimensions of `\(X\)` are large and `\(N\)` is finite.


.hi[Propensity scores provide a solution] to this mess.
---
name: magic
## The magic

It turns out that if `\(\left( \text{Y}_{0i},\,\text{Y}_{1i} \right) \ci \text{D}_{i}|\text{X}_{i},\,\)` then we actually only need to match/condition on `\(p(\text{X}_{i}) = \mathop{E}\left[ \text{D}_{i} | \text{X}_{i} \right]\)`.


`\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)` is the .attn[propensity score]
, the probability of treatment given `\(\text{X}_{i}.\)`


.attn[Propensity-score theorem] If `\(\left( \text{Y}_{0i},\,\text{Y}_{1i} \right) \ci \text{D}_{i}|\text{X}_{i},\,\)` then `\(\left( \text{Y}_{0i},\,\text{Y}_{1i} \right) \ci \text{D}_{i}|p(\text{X}_{i}).\)`


This theorem extends our CIA to a one-dimensional score, avoiding the curse of dimensionality.

## Proof

---
name: proof


To prove this theorem, we will show `\(\mathop{\text{Pr}}\left(\text{D}_{i}=1 \mid \text{Y}_{0i},\, \text{Y}_{1i},\, p(\text{X}_{i})\right) = p(\text{X}_{i})\)`, _i.e._, `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` is independent of `\(\left( \text{Y}_{0i},\, \text{Y}_{1i} \right)\)` after conditioning on `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)`.

name: intuition
## Intuition

.qa[Q] What's going on here?

`\(\text{X}_{i}\)` carries way more information than `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)`, so how can we still get conditional independence of treatment by only conditioning on `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)`?


.qa[A].sub[.pink[1]] Conditional independence of treatment isn't about extracting all of the information possible from `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`. We actually only care about creating a situation in which `\(\text{D}_{i}|\)`something is independent of `\(\left( \text{Y}_{0i},\,\text{Y}_{1i} \right)\)`.


.qa[A].sub[.pink[2]] Back to our main concern: .hi[selection bias]. People select into treatment. If `\(\text{X}\)` says two people were equally likely to be treated, and if `\(\text{X}_{i}\)` explains all of selection (CIA), then there cannot be selection between these two people.
---
name: estimation
## Estimation

So where do propensity scores come from?


We estimate them—and there are a lot of ways to do that.

1. Flexible (_i.e._, interactions) logit specification
2. Kernel regression (remember kernel functions?)
3. Many others—machine learning, series-logit estimator, *etc.*


.qa[Q] Can we just use plain OLS (linear probability model)?


.qa[A] Sort of. Think about FWL. This route is going to be the same as a regression conditioning on `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.

---
## Estimation

From *MHE* (p. 83)

.qa[Question]

&gt; A big question here is how to best model and estimate `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)`...

.qa[Answer]

&gt; The answer to this is inherently application-specific. A growing empirical literature suggests that a logit model for the propensity score with a few polynomial terms in continuous covariates works well in practice...
---
name: application
## Application

So you have some estimated propensity scores `\(\hat{p}(\text{X}_{i})\)`. What next?


.note[Option 1] Conditioning via regression


.note[Option 1a] Use a .b[regression to condition] on `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)`, _i.e._,
$$
`\begin{align}
   \text{Y}_{i} = \alpha + \delta \text{D}_{i} + \beta p(\text{X}_{i}) + u_i \tag{1a}
\end{align}`
$$


.note[Option 1b] If we think treatment effects are heterogeneous and may covary with `\(\text{X}\)`, then we might want to also .b[interact] treatment with `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)`, _i.e._,
$$
`\begin{align}
   \text{Y}_{i} = \alpha + \delta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \delta_2 \text{D}_{i} p(\text{X}_{i}) + \beta p(\text{X}_{i}) + u_i \tag{1b}
\end{align}`
$$
---
name: heterogeneity
## Heterogeneity with regression

Let's think a bit more about heterogeneous treatment effects in this setting.
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{0i} &amp;= \alpha + \beta \text{X}_{i} + u_i \\
  \text{Y}_{1i} &amp;= \text{Y}_{0i} + \delta_1 + \delta_2 \text{X}_{i}
\end{align}`
$$
_i.e._, the treatment effect depends upon `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.


`\(\text{Y}_{i} = \text{D}_{i}\text{Y}_{1i} + \left( 1 - \text{D}_{i} \right) \text{Y}_{0i}\)`

.pad-left[
`\(= \text{D}_{i}\bigg( \text{Y}_{0i} + \delta_1 + \delta_2 \text{X}_{i} \bigg) + \left( 1 - \text{D}_{i} \right) \text{Y}_{0i}\)`
]

.pad-left[
`\(= \text{Y}_{0i} + \delta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \delta_2 \text{D}_{i} \text{X}_{i}\)`
]

.pad-left[
`\(= \alpha + \delta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \delta_2 \text{D}_{i} \text{X}_{i} + \beta \text{X}_{i} + u_i\)`
]

---
## Heterogeneity

This final equation
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \alpha + \delta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \delta_2 \text{D}_{i} \text{X}_{i} + \beta \text{X}_{i} + u_i
\end{align}`
$$


suggests that we want `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)` *and* `\(\text{D}_{i}p(\text{X}_{i})\)`, _i.e._,
$$
`\begin{align}
   \text{Y}_{i} = \alpha + \delta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \delta_2 \text{D}_{i} p(\text{X}_{i}) + \beta p(\text{X}_{i}) + u_i \tag{1b}
\end{align}`
$$


which yields
1. a .hi-slate[group-specific treatment effect] `\(\delta_1 + \delta_2 \text{X}_{i}\)` for each `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`

2. an .hi-slate[average treatment effect] `\(\delta_1 + \delta_2 \overline{p}(\text{X}_{i})\)`
---
## More flexibility

We motivated propensity scores with a desire to reduce dimensionality and estimate/choose/assume fewer parameters.

Adding `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)` and `\(\text{D}_{i}p(\text{X}_{i})\)` as covariates in a linear regression doesn't quite exhaust our potential for flexible/nonparametric estimation.

---
name: blocking
## Blocking

.note[Option 2] Block (stratify) on propensity scores.


1. Divide the range of `\(\hat{p}(\text{X}_{i})\)` into `\(K\)` blocks (_e.g._, 0.05-wide blocks).

1. Place each observation into a block via its `\(\hat{p}(\text{X}_{i})\)`.

1. Calculate `\(\hat{\tau}_k\)` for each block via difference in means.

1. Average the `\(\hat{\tau}_k\)` using their shares of the sample, _i.e._,

$$
`\begin{align}
  \hat{\tau}_\text{Block} = \sum_{k = 1}^K  \hat{\tau}_k \dfrac{N_{1k} + N_{0k}}{N}
\end{align}`
$$


.note[Note] Blocking is similar to NN/kernel matching using `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)` as distance.
---
## Choosing blocks

Blocking on propensity scores requires defining defining blocks.

One common route involves some iteration.

1. .hi[Choose blocks].

1. Check the .hi[balance of the covariates] within each block..super[.pink[†]]

  - If covariates are .pink[not balanced], then split your blocks and repeat.

  - If covariates are .pink[balanced], then stop.

.footnote[.pink[†] Keep multiple-hypothesis testing in mind. With many covariates and many blocks, you are bound to find statistically significant relationships—even if you are balanced in truth.]

---
## Overlap

Blocking emphasizes our overlap assumption, _i.e._, `\(0&lt;\mathop{\text{Pr}}\left(\text{D}_{i} | \text{X}_{i}\right)&lt;1\)`.

If a block contains zero treated/control units, we cannot calculate `\(\hat{\tau}_k\)`.


.attn[Caution] Logit can hide violations—it forces `\(0 &lt; \hat{p}(\text{X}_{i}) &lt; 1\)`.


.note[Common practice] Empirically enforce overlap:

- Drop control units with `\(\hat{p}(\text{X}_{i})\)` below the minimum propensity score in the treatment group.

- Drop treated units with `\(\hat{p}(\text{X}_{i})\)` above the maximum propensity score in the control group.
---
name: weighting
## Weighting

.note[Option 3] Weight observations by the inverse propensity score.


.qa[Q] How does weighting by `\(1/\hat{p}(\text{X}_{i})\)` make sense?


.qa[A] Consider our old (likely biased) friend the difference in means, _i.e._,
$$
`\begin{align}
  \hat{\tau}_\text{Diff} = \overline{\text{Y}}_\text{T} - \overline{\text{Y}}_\text{C} = \dfrac{\sum_i \text{D}_{i} \text{Y}_{i}}{\sum_i \text{D}_{i}} - \dfrac{\sum_i \left(1 - \text{D}_{i}\right) \text{Y}_{i}}{\sum_i \left(1 - \text{D}_{i}\right)}
\end{align}`
$$
which we've discussed is biased due to selection into treatment, _i.e._,
$$
`\begin{align}
  \mathop{E}\left[ \text{Y}_{0i} | \text{D}_{i} = 1 \right] \neq \mathop{E}\left[ \text{Y}_{0i} \right]
\end{align}`
$$
---
## Weighting, justified

Suppose we know `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)` and we weight each .hi-pink[treated] individual by `\(1/p(\text{X}_{i})\)`


`\(\mathop{E}\left[ \dfrac{\text{D}_{i} \text{Y}_{i}}{p(\text{X}_{i})} \right]\)`

 `\(= \mathop{E}\left[ \dfrac{\text{D}_{i}\left(\text{D}_{i}\text{Y}_{1i} + (1-\text{D}_{i})\text{Y}_{0i}\right)}{p(\text{X}_{i})} \right]\)`

 `\(= \mathop{E}\left[ \dfrac{\text{D}_{i} \text{Y}_{1i}}{p(\text{X}_{i})} \right]\)`

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  `\(= \mathop{E}\!\bigg( \mathop{E}\left[ \dfrac{\text{D}_{i}\text{Y}_{1i}}{p(\text{X}_{i})} \;\middle|\; \text{X}_{i} \right] \bigg)\)`

 `\(= \mathop{E}\!\bigg( \dfrac{\mathop{E}\left[ \text{D}_{i} \mid \text{X}_{i} \right] \mathop{E}\left[ \text{Y}_{1i} \mid \text{X}_{i} \right]}{p(\text{X}_{i})} \bigg)\)`

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  `\(= \mathop{E}\!\bigg( \dfrac{p(\text{X}_{i}) \mathop{E}\left[ \text{Y}_{1i} \mid \text{X}_{i} \right]}{p(\text{X}_{i})} \bigg)\)`

 `\(= \mathop{E}\!\bigg( \mathop{E}\left[ \text{Y}_{1i} \mid \text{X}_{i} \right] \bigg)\)`

 `\(\color{#e64173}{= \mathop{E}\left[ \text{Y}_{1i} \right]}\)`


Similarly, weighting .hi-purple[control] individuals by `\(1/(1-p(\text{X}_{i}))\)` yields
$$
`\begin{align}
  \mathop{E}\left[ \dfrac{(1-\text{D}_{i})\text{Y}_{i}}{1-p(\text{X}_{i})} \right] = \color{#6A5ACD}{\mathop{E}\left[ \text{Y}_{0i} \right]}
\end{align}`
$$
---
## Weighting: The estimator

Thus, we can estimate an unbiased treatment effect via
$$
`\begin{align}
  \hat{\tau}_{p\text{Weight}} = \dfrac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ \dfrac{\text{D}_{i}\text{Y}_{i}}{p(\text{X}_{i})} - \dfrac{(1-\text{D}_{i}\text{Y}_{i})}{1 - p(\text{X}_{i})} \right]
\end{align}`
$$


.note[Intuition] We're trying to overcome selection bias, _i.e._, treated individuals were more likely to be treated as a function of `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`—producing higher `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)`.


We want to get back to *as-good-as random* variation in treatment.

So we upweight .pink[(**1**) .hi-pink[treated] individuals with low] `\(\color{#e64173}{p(\text{X}_{i})}\)` and .purple[(**2**) .hi-purple[control] observations with high] `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{p(\text{X}_{i})}\)`.
---
## Weighting: The example

Suppose for some individual `\(i\)`, `\(p(\text{X}_{i}) = 0.80\)`.


This propensity score says someone with this set of `\(\text{X}_{i}\)` was four-times more likely to be .hi-pink[treated] than .hi-purple[control].


Our weights fix this imbalance for each `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.


- If `\(i\)` is .hi-pink[treated], then her weight is `\(1/p(\text{X}_{i}) = 1/0.80 = 1.25\)`


- If `\(i\)` is .hi-purple[control], then her weight is `\(1/(1-p(\text{X}_{i})) = 1/(1-0.80) = 5\)`


And guess what `\(5/1.25\)` is...

 `\(4\)`!

 This weighting scheme gets us back to equal representation for each set of `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.
---
## Weighting: Last issue

.note[Practical issue] Nothing guarantees `\(\sum_i \hat{p}(\text{X}_{i}) = 1\)`.


.note[Solution] Normalize weights by their total sum.


Applying the normalized (and estimated) propensity scores
$$
`\begin{align}
  \hat{\tau}_{p\text{Weight}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \dfrac{ \dfrac{\text{D}_{i}\text{Y}_{i}}{\hat{p}(\text{X}_{i})} }{\sum_{i} \dfrac{\text{D}_{i}}{\hat{p}(\text{X}_{i})}} -
  \sum_{i=1}^N \dfrac{ \dfrac{(1-\text{D}_{i})\text{Y}_{i}}{1-\hat{p}(\text{X}_{i})} }{\sum_{i} \dfrac{(1-\text{D}_{i})}{1-\hat{p}(\text{X}_{i})}}
\end{align}`
$$


Hirano, Imbens, and Ridder (2003) suggests this estimator is efficient.

name: two
## Why choose one?

There's nothing special about weighted averages—regression can weight.

Thus, a .hi-slate[regression-based estimate]
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \alpha + \text{X}_{i}\beta + \tau \text{D}_{i} + u_i
\end{align}`
$$
with .hi-slate[weights]
$$
`\begin{align}
  w_i = \sqrt{\dfrac{\text{D}_{i}}{\hat{p}(\text{X}_{i})} + \dfrac{(1-\text{D}_{i})}{1-\hat{p}(\text{X}_{i})}}
\end{align}`
$$
offers a *doubly robust* property—you have two chances to be right: `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)` or the regression specification.
---
## Why choose one? Part two

An alternative, doubly robust method combines propensity-score blocking with regression.


.note[Step 1] For each block `\(k\)`, we run the regression
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \alpha_k + \text{X}_{i} \beta_k + \tau_k \text{D}_{i} + u_i
\end{align}`
$$


.note[Step 2] Aggregate block-level treatment-effect estimates
$$
`\begin{align}
  \hat{\tau} = \sum_{k=1}^K \hat{\tau}_k \dfrac{N_{1k} + N_{0k}}{N}
\end{align}`
$$
---
## Major requirements

Don't get (too) caught up in the bells and whistles.

We still have two .hi-slate[major] requirements for any of these methods to work?


1. Is the .hi-slate[conditional-independence assumption] true?


2. Do we have .hi-slate[overlap] between treatment and control units.


We can look for evidence of (.hi-slate[2]) in the data—particularly if we're using propensity-score methods..super[.pink[†]]

How? Plot the distributions of `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)` for .hi-pink[T] and .hi-purple[C].

.footnote[.pink[†] Checking for overlap in `\(\text{X}\)`-space, can be tough as the dimensions of `\(\text{X}\)` expand.
