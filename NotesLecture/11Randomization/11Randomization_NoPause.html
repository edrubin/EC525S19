## Inference recap

Our inference techniques have focused on (asymptotic) .attn[analytical methods].

1. Choose (or derive) an estimator

2. Derived the estimator's (asymptotic) distribution.super[.pink[†]]

3. Construct confidence intervals or hypothesis tests

.footnote[
.pink[†] And, consequently, standard errors.

name: resampling
## Resampling

.attn[Resampling methods] offers a different, more computationally intense (less asymptoically intense) approach.


A .attn[resampling method] involves repeatedly drawing samples (*resampling*) from a dataset and refitting the model of interest on each sample. We can learn about the behavior of the model through its performance across the many iterations..super[.pink[†]]

.footnote[
.pink[†] This approach is very similar to our Monte Carlo simulations, except that we will sample *with replacement* from a single dataset.

# The bootstrap

---
name: boot
class: inverse, middle
---
## Basics

.attn[Bootstrapping] resamples, .it[with replacement], from the original dataset.


- In each sample, we apply our estimator.
- Then, we consider the distribution/properties of these estimates.

This resampling helps us better understand the uncertainty associated with our estimator (within the current data setting).

---
name: boot-formal
## More formally

Let's formalize the bootstrap a bit.
- `\(Z\)` denotes our original dataset (_e.g._, `\(Z = \left[ \text{Y} \mid \text{X} \right]\)` in our standard setup).

- `\(\hat\alpha(Z)\)` refers to the estimate for `\(\alpha\)` derived from our dataset `\(Z\)`.

- We draw `\(B\)` bootstrap samples `\(b\in \left\{ 1,\,\ldots,\, B \right\}\)`.

- `\(Z^{\star 1}\)` represents our first bootstrap sample `\(\left( b=1 \right)\)`.

- `\(\hat{\alpha}^{\star 1} = \hat\alpha(Z^{\star1})\)` is our estimator evaluated on the first bootstrap sample.


The .attn[bootstrapped standard error] of `\(\hat\alpha\)` is the standard deviation of the `\(\hat\alpha^{\star b}\)`

$$
`\begin{align}
  \mathop{\text{SE}_{B}}\left( \hat\alpha \right) = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} \left( \hat\alpha^{\star b} - \dfrac{1}{B} \sum_{\ell=1}^{B} \hat\alpha^{\star \ell} \right)^2}
\end{align}`

## Comparison

In this 10,000-sample bootstrap, we calculate a standard error for `\(\hat\beta_1\)` of approximately 0.777.


If we go the old-fashioned OLS route `\(\left( s^2 \left(\text{X}'\text{X}\right)^2 \right)\)`, we estimate 0.673.

Not bad.

## Motivation

Consider the null hypothesis of *no average treatment effect*, _i.e._,
.center[
H.sub[o]:  `\(\overline{\text{Y}}_{0} = \overline{\text{Y}}_{1}  \quad \left(\implies \overline{\tau}=0 \right)\)`
]


We've discussed how randomization avoids the pitfalls of selection bias.


Randomization can also clarify inference—helping quantify uncertainty.


.qa[Q] How?


.qa[A] We know exactly how the randomness happened (we assigned it), so we don't need parametric assumptions to derive a distribution under H.sub[o]!
&lt;br&gt; We use the .hi[experimental design], rather than a probability model.

## Tea drinkers

.ex[Classic example] Sir R. A. Fisher had a colleague who claimed to be able to tell whether the tea was poured into milk *or* milk was poured into the tea..super[.pink[†]]

.footnote[
.pink[†] Don't worry, Fisher is known for more than this one experiment.
]


Being the friend he was, Fisher designed an experiment to determine whether his colleague was telling the truth.


Fisher randomized the order of 8 cups of tea:

- 4 cups with .hi-purple[m]ilk added first
- 4 cups with .hi-pink[t]ea added first


Vindication! His colleague got all 8 correct.
&lt;br&gt;.qa[Q] With random guessing, how likely is correctly guessing all 8 cups?
---
## Tea drinkers 2

.qa[Q] With random guessing, how likely is correctly guessing all 8 cups?


This question reflects our understanding of a .hi-slate[*p*-value].

If Fisher's colleague had no ability and simply guessed (H.sub[o]), what is the probability she would have guessed all 8 cups correctly?


Fisher's H.sub[o]: the answers were unrelated to the cups' actual contents.

Under this hypothesis, we can re-randomize the cups and see how many times her answer was perfectly correct.


This is the idea behind .attn[permutation testing] and .attn[randomization inference].

name: perm-gen
## Generalization

The procedure for permutation-based hypothesis testing.super[.pink[†]] is the same as our "standard" asymptotic-based hypothesis testing.

.footnote[
.pink[†] Also called *Fisher's exact test*, as you get exact *p*-values.
]


1. .hi-slate[Define hypotheses], H.sub[o] and H.sub[a].
1. Choose our .hi-slate[rejection threshold] `\(\alpha\)` (tolerated type-I error rate).
1. Choose a .hi-slate[test statistic] that is a function of our sample.
1. Derive/calculate the .hi-slate[test statistic's distribution .it[under H.sub[o]]].
1. .hi-slate[Compute the *p*-value] by comparing test stat. to its H.sub[o] distribution.
1. .hi-slate[Conclusions]—reject or fail to reject H.sub[o].


.note[The difference:] Permutation tests use the randomization's mechanism to construct the test-statistic's exact distribution under H.sub[o].

---
## More generally

Fisher focused on testing a .attn[sharp null hypothesis]—no effect *for anyone*, _i.e._,
.center[
H.sub[o]: `\(\text{Y}_{1i} - \text{Y}_{0i} = 0 \enspace \forall i \quad \left( \implies \tau_i = 0 \enspace \forall i \right)\)`
]
against an alternative hypothesis that someone has a non-zero effect
.center[
H.sub[a]: `\(\enspace \text{Y}_{1i} - \text{Y}_{0i} \neq 0\)` for some `\(i\)` `\(\left( \implies \exists i \enspace \text{s.t.} \enspace \tau_i \neq 0\right)\)`
]


A .attn[sharp null hypothesis] is specified *for all individuals*, *e.g.*,
.center[
H.sub[o]: `\(\text{Y}_{1i} - \text{Y}_{0i} = C \enspace \forall i\)`
]

which differs from the ATE-based nulls that we normally consider, *e.g.*,
.center[
H.sub[o]: `\(\mathop{E}\left[\text{Y}_{1i} - \text{Y}_{0i}\right] = C\)`.
]
---
name: perm-insight
## Key insight

Our estimate (or test statistic) is a function of

1. individuals' responses `\(\left( \text{Y}_{i} \right)\)`
2. individuals' treatment assignments `\(\left( \text{D}_{i} \right)\)`


.hi-slate[Under the sharp null] H.sub[o]: `\(\tau_i=0\)` `\(\left( \forall i \right)\)`

- `\(\text{Y}_{0i} = \text{Y}_{1i} = \text{Y}_{i} \enspace \forall i\)` (*i.e.*, changing `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` will not affect observed `\(\text{Y}_{i}\)`)


- Permutations of `\(\text{D}\)` construct the *exact* null distribution (unchanged `\(\text{Y}\)`).


The number of possible permutations can get big
—*e.g.*, 500 treated and 500 control has 2.7 `\(\times\)` 10.super[299] options.
 Approximate the distribution by sampling.

---
## On average

The sharp null was central to Fisher's interpretation.

[Neyman *et al.* (1935)](https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.uoregon.edu/stable/2983637) extended.super[.pink[†]] this idea of permutation-based tests to the average treatment effect (testing H.sub[o]: `\(\mathop{E}\left[ \text{Y}_{1i} \right] - \mathop{E}\left[ \text{Y}_{0i} \right] = 0\)`).

Neyman and others also added standard errors and confidence intervals.

.footnote[
.pink[†] Fisher, paraphrased: .bigger[🤬]
&lt;br&gt;.pink[††] *Permutation tests* and *Randomization inference* are not the most strictly defined terms.
]


These extensions have come to be known as .attn[randomization inference]..super[.pink[††]]
---
layout: true
# Randomization inference

---
class: inverse, middle
name: random
---
name: random-setup
## Setup

In order to .hi-slate[generalize our null hypothesis to the average treatment effect],

.center[
H.sub[o]: `\(\overline{\tau} = 0 \implies \mathop{E}\left[ \text{Y}_{1i} - \text{Y}_{0i} \right] = 0\)`
]

we have to give up something.

1. If we want an exact null distribution, then we must .hi-pink[assume a uniform treatment effect].
 (Assuming our way back to a sharp null.)


2. If we want to avoid assuming `\(\tau_i = \overline{\tau} \enspace \forall i\)`, then we have to .hi-purple[accept a non-exact null distribution]. (We don't observe `\(\text{Y}_{0i}\)` for `\(\text{D}_{i}=1\)`.)


If we don't like either option, then we need to go back to deriving asymptotic properties via probability modeling assumptions.
---
## Implementation

Once we decide which simplification we're willing to accept, we proceed similarly to permutation tests:

- shuffle `\(\text{D}\)` in a way that mimics treatment assignment

- collect test statistics from each iteration


.note[Note] Monte Carlo simulations, bootstrap, permutation tests, and randomization all apply very similar processes.

---
## (Which) Test statistics

We still need to choose a test statistic on which we base the *p*-value.

- The .hi-slate[actual estimate]—difference in means or coefficient
- .hi-slate[Transformed estimates]
- .hi-slate[Quantiles], *e.g.*, the median
- .hi-slate[_t_ statistic]
- .hi-slate[Rank] statistics


We can also extend this idea to .hi-pink[confidence intervals].

.ex[*E.g.*,] Use the point estimates associated with the 2.5.super[th] and 95.super[th] percentiles to construct a 95% confidence interval.

## Example

Back to the LaLonde NSW dataset. We previously estimated



- the NSW increased real earnings by `\(\color{#e64173}{\hat{\beta}_1}\approx\)` .pink[$886.30]
- (het.-robust) standard error of .pink[$488.20]
- _t_ statistic `\(\color{#e64173}{t_\text{stat}}\approx\)` .pink[1.82] with *p*-value `\(\approx\)` .pink[0.0699]


Let's re-randomize treatment 10,000 times. In each .hi-purple[iteration] `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{r}\)`, calculate

1. `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\hat{\beta}_{1}^{r}}\)`, the .hi-purple[point estimate] (the regression coefficient)
1. `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{t_\text{stat}^{r}}\)`, the .hi-purple[_t_ statistic]


Then calculate the implied *p*-values using the location of `\(\color{#e64173}{\hat\beta_1}\)` and `\(\color{#e64173}{t_\text{stat}}\)` in the distributions of `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\hat{\beta}_1^r}\)` and `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{t_\text{stat}^r}\)`, respectively..super[.pink[†]]

.footnote[

## Example: Re-randomization

The main decision is how to generate treatment.

.qa[Q] Should we permute `\(\text{D}\)` or draw `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` for each individual?.super[.pink[†]]

.footnote[
.pink[†] The difference is in whether we hold the number of treated individuals constant.
]



.qa[A] How was the original randomization conducted?


We'll assume the NSW started with a set number of treatments to disperse.

---
layout: true
class: clear

---

First, we'll write a function that performs one iteration.

```r
# Arguments: 'i' (iteration), 'n_t' (# of trt)
fun_randomization &lt;- function(i) {
  # Sample the treatment vector. NOTE: Sampling WITHOUT replacement
  t_i &lt;- sample(nsw_df$treat, size = nrow(nsw_df), replace = F)
  # Regression using our re-randomized treatment
  est_i &lt;- lm_robust(re78 ~ t_i, data = nsw_df) %&gt;% tidy()
  # Return tibble with iteration, point estimate, and test statistic
  tibble(i, est = est_i[2,"estimate"], t_stat = est_i[2,"statistic"])
}
```


And now run the re-randomization function 10,000 times.

```r
# Set up parallelization and seed
plan(multiprocess, workers = 4); set.seed(1234)
# Run the simulation 1e4 times
random_df &lt;- future_map_dfr(

2. Find all values of `\(\tau_o\)` that do not reject `\(\color{#e64173}{\hat{\tau}}\)` at the 5% level.

&gt; Although these methods [regression] remain the most popular way of analyzing data from randomized experiments, .purple[we suggest caution in using them].

&gt; ... In particular there is a disconnect between the way the conventional assumptions in regression analyses are formulated and the implications of randomization. As a result it is easy for the researcher using regression methods to go beyond analyses that are justified by randomization, and end up with analyses that rely on a .purple[difficult-to-assess mix of randomization assumptions, modeling assumptions, and large sample approximation].

&gt; Ultimately .purple[we recommend that researchers wishing to use regression or other model-based methods rather than the randomization-based methods we prefer, do so with care]. For example, using only indicator variables based on partitioning the covariate space, rather than using multi-valued variables as covariates in the regression function preserves many of the finite sample properties that simple comparisons of means have, and leads to regression estimates with clear interpretations. In addition, .purple[in many cases the potential gains from regression adjustment can also be captured by careful ex ante design], that is, through stratified randomized experiments to be discussed in the next section, without the potential costs associated with ex post regression adjustment.
